# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing
Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to optimize the speed and efficiency of the Mercedes-Benz car testing system by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Specifically, this project aims to reduce the time a car spends on the test bench while maintaining the high-quality standards set by Mercedes-Benz.

The core challenge is to identify the best possible combinations of car features that allow for quicker testing without compromising the reliability and performance evaluation. To achieve this, the project applies a systematic data-driven approach that involves several critical steps: Data Acquisition, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, Model Training, and Prediction.

Detailed Project Description
1. Data Acquisition
The project begins with collecting relevant data related to the testing process of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. This dataset includes various features representing vehicle specifications, test parameters, and performance metrics. Accurate and comprehensive data acquisition is vital to ensure that the model can learn meaningful patterns and relationships.

2. Data Wrangling
Raw data is often incomplete, inconsistent, or noisy. The data wrangling process involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis. This step ensures that the input data is accurate, reliable, and ready for the subsequent modeling process.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the underlying structure and characteristics of the data. It includes:

Visualizing feature distributions and relationships

Identifying correlations between variables

Detecting outliers or anomalies

Gaining insights into feature importance

This analysis guides the selection of features and helps to detect any data issues early.

4. Dimensionality Reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
The dataset initially contains a large number of features, which increases computational time and complexity. PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming the original features into a smaller set of uncorrelated components that still capture the majority of the data variance.

This reduction helps to decrease the time the car spends on the test bench by focusing on the most significant features.

It also improves the efficiency and speed of the machine learning model without sacrificing the accuracy of predictions.

5. Model Fitting and Prediction
For the regression task of predicting testing time or efficiency, the project uses the XGBoost Regressor, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. Key points about model fitting include:

Comparison with other regression algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests shows that XGBoost consistently achieves a lower mean squared error (MSE), indicating better prediction accuracy.

The model is trained on the reduced-dimensional data (after PCA) to optimize computational resources.

Once trained, the model can predict the expected testing time based on given feature combinations, helping engineers select optimal configurations.

Key Benefits and Outcomes
Optimized testing time on the bench, leading to cost savings and increased throughput in the testing facility.
