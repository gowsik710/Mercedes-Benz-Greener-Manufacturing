# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing
The main objective of this project is to optimize the speed of the Mercedes-Benz testing system for many possible feature combinations using a powerful machine learning algorithmic approach without reducing the Mercedes-Benz standards. The process involves Data Acquisition, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction using PCA to bring down the number of dimensions to reduce the time that the car spends on the test bench, Model Fitting, and prediction. This project is completed using a powerful XG Boost Regressor machine learning algorithm which provides better mean squared error value than the other algorithms like Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
