## Detailed Project Description

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Collect data related to Mercedes-Benz vehicle testing.
- Dataset includes vehicle specifications, test parameters, and performance metrics.
- Ensures the model learns meaningful patterns.

### 2. Data Wrangling
- Clean raw data by:
  - Handling missing values
  - Correcting inconsistencies
  - Transforming data into a usable format
- Ensures data accuracy and reliability for modeling.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize feature distributions and relationships.
- Identify correlations between variables.
- Detect outliers or anomalies.
- Gain insights into feature importance.
- Helps in early data issue detection and feature selection.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Reduce the number of features to a smaller set of uncorrelated components.
- Capture most data variance while lowering complexity.
- Focus on significant features to decrease car testing time.
- Improve model efficiency and speed without losing accuracy.

### 5. Model Fitting and Prediction
